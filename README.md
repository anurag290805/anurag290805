### Hi, I'm Anurag Srivastava 👋

I'm a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at VIT Chennai with a 
passion for building things — both physical and digital. My work spans 
mechanical design and fabrication, embedded systems, and software 
development, giving me a cross-disciplinary perspective that I bring 
to every project I work on.
